## Question 1 <br>

![] (C:\Users\HP\Desktop\经济学原理\homework\homework 02\question 1)<br>


## Question 2 <br>

ANS:  The price of babysitting services in 2020 will go higher.Because babies are five years        old now,demand for babysitters is high, while supply is consistant,so the price will        be higher.<br>

      The price of babysitting services in 2030 will be lower than 2015, because 15-year-old        teenagers can be babysitters.Supply becomes higher, while demand is less than supply.        So the price will be lower.<br>
      
      
## Question 3  <br>

ANS: A fall in the price of flour.<br>

     A fall in the price of flour makes the price of producing and buying bagels lower. So the  demand and supply for bagels become higher.The equilibrium quantity of bagels increases, which leads to the demand for cream cheese increase. Then the equilibrium price of cream cheese have risen.<br>

## Question 4  <br>

(a) ![](C:\Users\HP\Desktop\经济学原理\homework\homework 02\question 4)<br>

(b) equilibrium price=8     equilibrium quantity=6600
     9000-300p=1000+700p
             p=8
     1000+700p=9000-300p=6600  <br>
     
(c) $Q_s$ = 1000+700*20=15000 <br>

    $Q_d$ = 9000-300*20=3000 <br>
    
    3000 chocolate bars will be sold. Supply for chocolate bars is much larger than demand, so chocolate bars will be surplus. And the price will fall. <br>
    

## Question 5  <br>

 Read the article “The Rich vs Poor Debate: Are Kids Normal or Inferior Goods?” Summarize the author’s arguments. Do you agree with his analysis? Why or why not? 
  I agree with his ananlysis and I think kids are inferior goods. The poor generally have more kids while the rich usually just have one or two kids. In my opinion,  there maybe some possibles reasons below.  <br>
  
  Firstly, I think financial situation determined their decisions on having kids.The poor have less money and they need kids to help them with housework, so they can have more time to work outside and make more money. When their kids grow up, they have abilities to work outside as their parents. So more kids means more labor force to earn money and more opportunities to change the poor financial situation in the faminy. Kids represent the poor parents'  hope for better life. While in the rich family, parents don't need to worry about money, they just want kids to become healthy and excellent.
So they have fewer kids to make sure they have enough time on each kid to have better education. The poor pay more attention to the quantity of kids while the rich concern more on the quality.  <br>

  Secondly, the rich people usually have wholesome media and health services and they have enough money to treat an illness. So the death rate of their kids is lower than the poor's kids. Although it's cruel to say, the poor need to have more kids to make sure there will be one who grow up healthily no matter in the past or present. <br>
    
  Thirdly, the poor need kids to provide for their aged in the future, more kids means more living security. But the rich usually don't need this.  <br>
    
  In my conclusion, financial situation and other elements influence the poor and the rich, which make them have different thoughts on having kids.And I think kids are inferior goods.
